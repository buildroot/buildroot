	help
	  Select the EROFS compression algorithm to use.

	  LZ4HC (LZ4 High Compression) is the default algorithm and
	  provides a good balance between compression ratio and speed,
	  with increasing levels the compression ratio increases at the
	  penalty of higher compression times, without significant
	  decompression penalty.

	  LZMA provides the best compression ratio but is significantly
	  slower both in compression and decompression, and higher
	  compression levels can have noticeable memory requirements.
