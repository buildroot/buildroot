Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!

Buildroot comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards. Run
'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.

Please feed suggestions, bug reports, insults, and bribes back to the
buildroot mailing list: buildroot@buildroot.org
You can also find us on #buildroot on OFTC IRC.

My part
- Add .config file for qemu
- Add build script to build
- Add git submodule for my application
- Add an external crosstool for build app and kernal( build script will help you to create external crosstool but you need to update for .config to internal crosstool then build and set it to external)
- Overlay rootfs for config syslogd
- Add script to run in fakeroot environment to modify your rootfs before building

To run my setup just: 
- Build your external crosstool: set crosstool as internal
- Build all: ./build_script.sh -full
