	  SPI testing utility (using spidev driver).

	  This package builds and installs the userspace 'spidev_test'
	  command. It is up to the user to ensure that the kernel
	  configuration has all suitable options enabled to allow a
	  proper operation of 'spidev_test'.

	  The version used is based on your toolchain headers version,
	  if it's older than 3.15 then 3.0 is used, up to headers 5.7
	  version 4.10 is used and otherwise version 5.8.
	  This means you won't have quad-pumped SPI support if your
	  toolchain is too old.
