	  A flexible cross-platform WebRTC client framework based on GStreamer.

	  OpenWebRTC is built on the belief that the WebRTC standard would
	  transcend the pure browser environment and that native apps,
	  implementing the same protocols and API's, would become an important
	  part of the WebRTC ecosystem. This is especially true on mobile
	  platforms where native app distribution is often preferred over pure
	  web apps. Native OpenWebRTC apps can either talk to other native apps
	  or browsers that support WebRTC. OpenWebRTC can also provide the
	  WebRTC-backend to web browsers.

	  Having independent, interoperable, implementations is important for
	  the health of any standard, and WebRTC is no exception. The ambition
	  of OpenWebRTC is to follow the WebRTC standard closely as it continues
	  to evolve.
