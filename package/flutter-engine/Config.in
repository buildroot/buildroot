	  Flutter is Google's SDK for crafting beautiful, fast user
	  experience for mobile, web, and desktop from a single
	  codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by
	  developers and organizations around the world, and is
	  free and open source.

	  The Flutter Engine is a portable runtime for hosting
	  Flutter applications. It implements Flutter's core
	  libraries, including animation and graphics, file and
	  network I/O, accessibility support, plugin architecture,
	  and a Dart runtime and compile toolchain. Most developers
	  will interact with Flutter via the Flutter Framework,
	  which provides a modern, reactive framework, and a rich
	  set of platform, layout and foundation widgets.

	bool "enable profiling"
	help
	  Some debugging ability is maintained—enough to profile your
	  apps performance. Profile mode is disabled on the emulator
	  and simulator, because their behavior is not representative
	  of real performance. Profile mode is similar to release mode,
	  with the following differences:

	  - Some service extensions, such as the one that enables the
	    performance overlay, are enabled.

	  - Tracing is enabled, and tools supporting source-level
	    debugging (such as DevTools) can connect to the process.

	  If this option is left unselected, the global option
	  BR2_ENABLE_RUNTIME_DEBUG determines whether to build Flutter
	  in release or debug mode.
