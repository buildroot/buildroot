	  libpeas is a gobject-based plugins engine, and is targeted at
	  giving every application the chance to assume its own
	  extensibility. It also has a set of features including, but
	  not limited to:
	    - multiple extension points
	    - On demand (lazy) programming language support for C,
	      Python and Lua
	    - Simplicity of the API
