	  This package builds and installs the Linux kernel driver for
	  the Mali Utgard GPU on Allwinner platforms, compatible with
	  recent Linux kernels (>= 4.4). Note that it should be
	  installed together with the corresponding userspace OpenGL
	  libraries, which are provided as binaries only at:
	  https://github.com/bootlin/mali-blobs

	  sunxi-mali-utgard-driver requires a Linux kernel >= 4.4
	  with the following options enabled:

	  - CONFIG_CMA
	  - CONFIG_DMA_CMA

	  starting from Linux Kernel >= 4.20 following options must be
	  enabled:
	  - CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_LEAK_PHYS_SMEM

	  The following kernel command line options must be passed:

	  - drm_kms_helper.drm_leak_fbdev_smem = 1
	    since drm_kms_helper.drm_leak_fbdev_smem is set to 0 by
	    default

	  - drm_kms_helper.drm_fbdev_overalloc >= 200
	    since the driver requires at least double buffering and
	    fails to work with the default value(100).
