	  Siproxd is a proxy/masquerading daemon for SIP (Session
	  Initiation Protocol), which is used in IP telephony. It
	  handles registrations of SIP clients on a private IP network
	  and performs rewriting of the SIP message bodies to make SIP
	  connections work via a masquerading firewall (NAT). It allows
	  SIP software clients (like kphone, linphone) or SIP hardware
	  clients (Voice over IP phones which are SIP-compatible, such
	  as those from Cisco, Grandstream or Snom) to work behind an IP
	  masquerading firewall or NAT router.
