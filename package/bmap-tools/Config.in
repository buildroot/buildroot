	  Tool to flash image files to block devices using the block map
	  bmaptool is a generic tool for creating the block map (bmap)
	  for a file, and copying files using the block map. The idea is
	  that large file containing unused blocks, like raw system
	  image files, can be copied or flashed a lot faster with
	  bmaptool than with traditional tools like "dd" or "cp".

	  Relevant optional dependencies:

	  - Busybox compiled with CONFIG_BZIP2, or BR2_PACKAGE_BZIP2,
	    to support bz2 compressed images

	  - BR2_PACKAGE_PIGZ for optimized gzip decompression

	  - Busybox compiled with CONFIG_LZOP, or BR2_PACKAGE_LZOP, to
	    support lzo compressed images.

	  - BR2_PACKAGE_ZIP to support zip compressed images

	  - BR2_PACKAGE_LZ4 to support lz4 compressed images

	  - BR2_PACKAGE_ZSTD to support zstd compressed images

	  - Busybox compiled CONFIG_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_* or
	    BR2_PACKAGE_TAR to support tar compressed images

	  - BR2_PACKAGE_OPENSSH to retrieve images over SSH.

	  - BR2_PACKAGE_SSHPASS to retrieve images over SSH if
	    password authentication is used.

	  Image signature verification is not supported as
	  python-gpgme is not available. Optimized bzip2 decompression
	  is not supported as pbzip2 is not available.
