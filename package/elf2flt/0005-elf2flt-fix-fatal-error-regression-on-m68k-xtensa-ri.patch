Subject: [PATCH] elf2flt: fix fatal error regression on m68k, xtensa, riscv64

Commit ba379d08bb78 ("elf2flt: fix for segfault on some ARM ELFs")
changed the condition of which input sections that should be included
in the .text output section from:
((a->flags & (SEC_DATA | SEC_READONLY)) == (SEC_DATA | SEC_READONLY))
to:
((a->flags & (SEC_DATA | SEC_READONLY | SEC_RELOC)) ==
(SEC_DATA | SEC_READONLY | SEC_RELOC))

On ARM, the .eh_frame input section does not have the SEC_RELOC flag set,
so on ARM, this change caused .eh_frame to move from .text to .data.

However, on e.g. m68k, xtensa and riscv64, the .eh_frame input section
does have the SEC_RELOC flag set, which means that the change in
commit ba379d08bb78 ("elf2flt: fix for segfault on some ARM ELFs")
caused .eh_frame to move in an opposite way, i.e. from .data to .text.

This resulted in a fatal error on m68k, xtensa and riscv64:
ERROR: text=0x3bab8 overlaps data=0x33f60 ?

This is because elf2flt cannot append to .text after .data has been
appended to.

Note that the binutils maintainer says that the correct thing is
to put read-only relocation data sections in .text:
https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/binutils/2019-10/msg00132.html

So the proper fix is probably to rewrite elf2flt so that it can append
to .text after .data has been appended to (which will require elf2flt
to move/relocate everything that has already been appended to .data,
since the virtual addresses are contiguous).

However, for now, add an exception for input sections which have all
three flags SEC_DATA, SEC_READONLY, and SEC_RELOC set, and which have a
name equal to a problematic input section (.eh_frame, .gcc_except_table).
That way, we get the same behavior as older elf2flt releases for m68k,
xtensa and riscv64, where we put read-only relocation data in .data,
which was working perfectly fine.

This exception will not change any behavior on ARM, as the .eh_frame
input section does not have flag SEC_RELOC set.
