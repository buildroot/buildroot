	  SPAKE2 password-authenticated key exchange (in pure python).

	  This library implements the SPAKE2 password-authenticated
	  key exchange ("PAKE") algorithm. This allows two parties,
	  who share a weak password, to safely derive a strong shared
	  secret (and therefore build an encrypted+authenticated
	  channel).
