	  QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and
	  virtualizer.

	  When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and
	  programs made for one machine (e.g. an ARM board) on a
	  different machine (e.g.  your own PC). By using dynamic
	  translation, it achieves very good performance.

	  When used as a virtualizer, QEMU achieves near native
	  performances by executing the guest code directly on the
	  host CPU. QEMU supports virtualization when executing under
	  the Xen hypervisor or using the KVM kernel module in
	  Linux. When using KVM, QEMU can virtualize x86, server and
	  embedded PowerPC, and S390 guests.

	help
	  Enable user mode network stack, which is the default
	  networking backend. It requires no administrator privileges
	  and generally is the easiest to use but has some
	  limitations:

	  - there is a lot of overhead so the performance is poor;
	  - in general ICMP does not work (can't ping from/to a guest)
	  - on Linux hosts, ping does work from within the guest, but it
	    needs initial setup by root (once per host)
	  - the guest is not directly accessible from the host or the
	    external network

	  User Networking is implemented using "slirp", which provides a
	  full TCP/IP stack within QEMU and uses that stack to implement
	  a virtual NAT'd network.

	  Notice that this option does not disable other networking
	  modes.
