Subject: [PATCH] remove dependency check on version file

$(VERSION_DEPS) includes dependencies from tzdata meaning applications
such as zic can't build from tzcode on their own.  Remove the dependency
to $(VERSION_DEPS) since it is not necessary to check for version updates
in released code.  This solves building zic from tzcode without needing
tzdata.
