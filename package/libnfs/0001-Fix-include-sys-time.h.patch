Subject: [PATCH] Fix include sys/time.h
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

POSIX says `struct timeval` is defined if <sys/time.h> is included.

Instead of the mess that is currently done based on the system on which
the stuff is being compiled, include it unconditionally.
