	  The DPAA2 architecture in Layerscape SoCs consists of
	  networking resources that can be assembled into various
	  nuggets of functionality, called "objects" (DPMAC, DPNI,
	  DPDMUX, DPSW etc), by the Management Complex (MC) firmware.

	  The MC firmware reads a file called Data Path Layout (DPL)
	  which describes the set of networking objects it should
	  create statically, at boot time.

	  The restool program is able to talk to the Management
	  Complex at runtime and permits the dynamic reconfiguration
	  of networking objects, as well as saving the current
	  configuration into a new DPL file. Without the restool
	  program, the only possible networking configuration is
	  that specified in the boot-time DPL file.
