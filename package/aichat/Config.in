	  AIChat helps seamlessly integrate different LLM models,
	  providing access via the CLI and network. It can serve
	  as a gateway to heterogeneous and distributed LLMs.

	  Handy features like roles, macros, and sessions help
	  simplify repetitive tasks and reuse of existing solutions.
	  Features like playgrounds and arenas help to explore and
	  compare models.
