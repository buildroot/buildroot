	  GNU poke is a new interactive editor for binary data. Not
	  limited to editing basic entities such as bits and bytes,
	  it provides a full-fledged procedural, interactive
	  programming language designed to describe data structures
	  and to operate on them. Once a user has defined a structure
	  for binary data (usually matching some file format) she can
	  search, inspect, create, shuffle and modify abstract entities
	  such as ELF relocations, MP3 tags, DWARF expressions,
	  partition table entries, and so on, with primitives
	  resembling simple editing of bits and bytes. The program
	  comes with a library of already written descriptions (or
	  "pickles" in poke parlance) for many binary formats.
