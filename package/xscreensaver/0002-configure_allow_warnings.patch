Description: Allow warnings from configure
 Since 6.03 the original configure script returns non-zero if a
 warning about configuration options versus detected capabilities
 has been issued, presumably to increase awareness of the warnings.
 To allow building on all architectures, while relying on the
 resulting HAVE_XX flags as usual, return with success at the end
 of the script.
