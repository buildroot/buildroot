	  Hardware/platform abstraction service for TPMs, HSMs, and
	  Root of Trust
	  PARSEC is the Platform AbstRaction for SECurity, an
	  open-source initiative to provide a common API to hardware
	  security and cryptographic services in a platform-agnostic
	  way. This abstraction layer keeps workloads decoupled from
	  physical platform details, enabling cloud-native delivery
	  flows within the data center and at the edge.
