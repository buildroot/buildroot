Subject: [PATCH] vsnprintf_s: Increase Buffer Size by 1

It is a buffer overflow warning that GCC 15.2 is catching.
The issue is that it's trying to write to `buf[len++]` when len could
potentially be 31, which would write to buf[31] in a buffer of size 32
(valid indices 0-31), but the len++ post-increment means it could
theoretically write beyond the buffer bounds.

Fixes
